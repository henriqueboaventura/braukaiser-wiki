                <div class="content-section"> <p>This article outlines the derivation of formulas that can be used to predict grist pH (and with it mash pH) based on the estimated beer color. It utilizes a correlation that exist between a malt's color and its pH properties. While this correlation is rather loose for base malts, it is sufficiently strong for specialty malts to allow the proposal of formulas that can predict the grist and mash pH from the beer's color. </p><p>When I talk about grist pH I mean the pH that is "inherent" to the grist and which can be measured when distilled (mineral free water) is used for mashing. </p><p>This article is rather heavy on math and formulas it is provided as a reference for brewers who want to know how mash pH and beer color can be connected on a mathematical level. </p><p>The resulting formula has been implemented in <a rel="nofollow" href="../documents/Kaiser_water_calculator_US_units.xls">Kaiser_water_calculator_US_units.xls</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="../documents/Kaiser_water_calculator.xls">Kaiser_water_calculator.xls</a> </p> <nav class="toc"><h2>Contents</h2> <ul> <li><a href="#How_mash_pH_and_beer_color_use_similar_formulas">How mash pH and beer color use similar formulas</a></li> <li><a href="#grists_with_roasted_malts">grists with roasted malts</a></li> <li><a href="#Theory_and_Practice">Theory and Practice</a></li> <li><a href="#From_grist_pH_to_mash_pH">From grist pH to mash pH</a></li> <li><a href="#References">References</a></li> </ul> </nav> <h1 id="How_mash_pH_and_beer_color_use_similar_formulas">How mash pH and beer color use similar formulas</h1> <p>To estimate the grist (or distilled water mash) pH the following formula can be used: </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_1.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 1.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_1.gif" width="376" height="50"/></a></div> (1)  <p>where </p> <ul><li> <b>pH<sub>grist</sub>:</b> is the distilled water mash pH of the resulting grist</li> <li> <b>pH<sub>bi</sub>:</b> is the distilled water mash pH of the base malt i</li> <li> <b>g<sub>bi</sub>:</b> is the base malt i's portion of the grist (g<sub>bi</sub> = 0..1)</li> <li> <b>g<sub>sj</sub>:</b> is the specialty malt j's portion of the grist (g<sub>bj</sub> = 0..1)</li> <li> <b>a<sub>sj</sub>:</b> is the specialty malt j's specific acidity in mEq/kg</li> <li> <b>B:</b> is the pH buffer capacity of the malt.

It simply does the following: The weighted average of the base malt pH and the titration end-point (5.7) of the specialty malts is calculated and used as a starting pH. Then the pH shift that stems from specialty malts is subtracted. This pH shift is proportional to the total acidity of the specialty malts. The proportionality factor is the pH buffer capacity B. </p>  <p>Most home brewing software calculates SRM as follows </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_2.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 2.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_2.gif" width="223" height="49"/></a></div> (2)  <p>where MCU means Malt Color Units.

This relationship only exists for crystal malts and lightly roasted malts <sup id="cite_ref-zymurgy_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-zymurgy-2">[2]</a></sup>. </p> <h1 id="grists_with_roasted_malts">grists with roasted malts</h1> <p>Let's assume that the color of the beer can be split into a color component from crystal, base and lighly roasted malts and a color component from strongly roasted malts.

To further simplify things we assume that there is only one type of roasted used, which has the color c<sub>r</sub>. The acidity for heavily roasted malts is independent of their color and was found to be around 40 mEq/kg or 18 mEq/lb. The factor of c<sub>r</sub>/c<sub>r</sub>, that is also applied, brings the malt's color into the equation even though it doesn't make a difference yet. </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_13.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 13.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_13.gif" width="153" height="46"/></a></div> (13)  <p>The MCU contribution from that roasted malt is </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_14.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 14.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_14.gif" width="125" height="36"/></a></div> (14)  <p>The general mash pH drop from roasted malts is </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_15a.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 15a.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_15a.gif" width="145" height="54"/></a></div> (15a)  <p>With (13) and (14) it changes to </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_15.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 15.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_15.gif" width="213" height="50"/></a></div> (15b)  <p>Thus (9) can be enhanced to </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_16.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 16.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_16.gif" width="433" height="52"/></a></div> (16)  <p>Some rearranging gives </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_17.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 17.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_17.gif" width="430" height="97"/></a></div> (17)  <p>(17) Is as far as the analytical approach makes sense. Now it is best to take a closer look at the terms and identify what they are, mean and, most importantly, how they relate to practical observations. </p><p>Term 1 represents the grist pH of a color less beer. Term 2 is a factor that depends on the strength of the beer (the inverse, m<sub>g</sub>/V<sub>w</sub>, is proportional to the starting extract content or original gravity of the beer). Term 3 is the color dependent pH drop for color contributed by crystal, base and lightly roasted malts. It uses MCU, but the relationship between MCU and SRM can be approximated using (10). Term 4 represents the pH drop from roasted malts. Note that it depends both on the color increase gained from roasted malts and the color of the roasted malt. This is to be expected since the acidity of roasted malts doesn't change with the malt color and darker roasted malts provide less acidity per color that lighter roasted malts. </p> <h1 id="Theory_and_Practice">Theory and Practice</h1> <p>While (17) can be used to predict the grist pH and with it mash pH, better correlation to actual mash pH observations is achieved by using the structure and some of the results of (17) and augmenting them with parameters derived from brewing practice. </p> <a href="assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_18.gif"><img alt="SRM to mash pH formula 18.gif" src="../assets/images/SRM_to_mash_pH_formula_18.gif" width="386" height="52"/></a></div> (18)  <p>Where </p> <ul><li> <b>pH<sub>0SMR</sub></b>: is the pH that the grist for a beer with a color of 0 SRM would have.
