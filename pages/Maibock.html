Contrary to popular belief, a Maibock is not a Helles brewed to Bock strength (by German law Bock means an original extract of more than 16 Plato) but more a modern Oktoberfest beer brewed to Bock strength, since it is not brewed from 100% Pilsner malt like a classic Helles is. This beer benefits from a fairly long lagering process (about 3 months) and should therefore be brewed in late December or early January to be ready to be tapped in Mai. Preferably while raising a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maibaum">Maibaum</a>. This Maibock targets an original extract amount of 16.5 Plato. which is where most of the German Maibocks are. Like almost any other German beer, you want this to be drinkable by the Mass (1L Glasses). </p><p><br/> </p> <nav class="toc"><h2>Contents</h2> <ul> <li><a href="#Water">Water</a></li> <li><a href="#Grist">Grist</a></li> <li><a href="#Hops">Hops</a></li> <li><a href="#Yeast">Yeast</a></li> <li><a href="#Mash">Mash</a></li> <li><a href="#Boil">Boil</a></li> <li><a href="#Primary_fermentation">Primary fermentation</a></li> <li><a href="#Aging.2FLagering">Aging/Lagering</a></li> </ul> </nav> <h1 id="Water">Water</h1> <p><i>for brewers who build their own water</i> </p><p>33L (assuming 25L (6.25 gal) pre-boil volume) reverse osmosis water + </p><p>0.55 CaSO4 (Gypsum) </p><p>0.55g MgSO4 (epsom salt) </p><p>1.3g CaCl2 (Calcium Chloride) </p><p>0.35g NaHCO3 (baking soda) </p><p>2.7g CaCO3 (chalk) </p><p><br/> (52 mg/L Ca; 3 mg/L Mg; 8 mg/L Na; 17 mg/L SO4; 23 mg/L Cl; 80 mg/L HCO3; Residual Alkalinity = 30 mg/L HCO3) </p> <h1 id="Grist">Grist</h1> <p>73% Weyermann Bohemian Pils (regular German Pilsner malt should work too) </p><p>20% Weyermann Munich Type II (this is the dark Munich.

I used an immersion chiller to chill quickly. If you generally have DMS problems with a less then 90min boil and a Pilsner malt grist, boil for 90 min. Chill to pitching temperature of 6-7 *C (43 - 45 *F). </p> <h1 id="Primary_fermentation">Primary fermentation</h1> <p>This is key: Keep the primary fermentation temp below or at 9 C for 2 weeks or until the fermentation activity has subsided significantly. In high gravity beers like Bocks yeast has a tendency to develop an elavated level of fusel alcohols. This will lead to an alcohol taste of the beer, but you don't want that. The less you are able to taste the alcohol the better. </p><p>I also strongly recommend the <a href="Fast_Ferment_Test.html" title="Fast Ferment Test">Fast Ferment Test</a> for that beer as it will tell you the limit of attenuation. You want the actual attenuation to be 4-6% below the limit of attenuation. If the fast ferment test finishes at 3.0 Plato, the beer should ideally finish at 3.6 Plato. But if the yeast stalls earlier, you will have to live with that. Hopefully the beer is not to sweet. You may raise the temp or add fresh yeast (in the form of <a href="Kraeusening.html" title="Kraeusening">Kraeusen</a> if possible). </p><p>In my case the FFT finished at 3.0 Plato and the beer finished at 4.1 Plato. This is a difference of 7% and I think the beer has a touch to much sweetness. Next time I'll be working better to get the yeast to go further. </p> <h1 id="Aging.2FLagering">Aging/Lagering</h1> <p>Once the beer is close (within 0.1 or 0.2 Plato) or at the desired final gravity, crash it to lagering temps (0-3 C) and lager for about 3 month or more. Then rack it off the sediment and serve. </p>
